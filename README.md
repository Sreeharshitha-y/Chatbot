# PDF Chatbot

Welcome to the PDF Chatbot project! This chatbot is designed to analyze PDF files using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique, providing a conversational interface for extracting insights from textual content within PDF documents.

## Overview

This chatbot leverages TF-IDF to process and understand the content of PDF files. TF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). The chatbot allows users to interactively query and analyze PDFs, extracting key information based on the significance of terms within the documents.

## Features

- **TF-IDF Analysis:** The chatbot computes TF-IDF scores to identify important terms within PDF files.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Engage in conversations with the chatbot to query specific information from PDF documents.
- **Support for Multiple PDFs:** Analyze and compare multiple PDF files within the same conversation session.
